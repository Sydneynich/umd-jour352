            <H1> Beyoncé</H1>
    
            <p>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biˈɒnseɪ/ ⓘ bee-ON-say;[4] born September 4, 1981)[5] is an American singer, songwriter, and businesswoman.
                 Known as "Queen Bey", she has been widely recognized for her boundary-pushing artistry, vocals, and performances. Her contributions to music 
                 and visual media and her concert performances have led her to become a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century. She was named the eighth-greatest 
                 singer of all time by Rolling Stone in 2023.</p>
                 <p>Beyoncé started performing in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of the R&B girl group 
                    Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003). She then 
                    released the commercially successful solo albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), and 4 (2011). In the mid-to-late-2010s, after creating her 
                    own management company Parkwood Entertainment, Beyoncé's artistry achieved widespread acclaim for releasing the sonically experimental visual albums 
                    Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which explored multiple societal themes such as infidelity, feminism, and womanism. Following the release of the 
                    LGBT-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022), she became the first solo artist to have their first seven studio albums debut at number one in the
                     United States. Its namesake concert run later became the highest-grossing tour of all time by a woman.[7]</p>

                         <p>Her collaborative music ventures include Everything Is Love (2018), an album with her husband Jay-Z, as the Carters, and the musical film 
                            Black Is King (2020), inspired by the music of the film soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift (2019). Homecoming: The Live Album (2019), a 
                            project encapsulating her 2018 Coachella performance, has been heralded as one of the best live albums of all time, lauded for wide-reaching 
                            curation from many eras of black musical history. Outside of music, she has starred as an actress in multiple films such as Austin Powers in 
                            Goldmember (2002), The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008), Obsessed (2009), and The Lion King (2019).
                            Having sold over 200 million records worldwide, Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[8][9] Her accolades include 32 
                            Grammy Awards, 26 MTV Video Music Awards (including the 2014 Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award), 24 NAACP Image Awards, 35 BET Awards, and 
                            17 Soul Train Music Awards, all of which are more than any other artist in the music industry. Her success during the 2000s earned her recognition
                             as the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s Top Certified Artist of the Decade and Billboard's Top Female Artist of the Decade.[10] 
                             In 2014, Billboard named her the highest-earning black musician of all time. She is the most successful black touring act in history according to 
                             Pollstar.[11] Time magazine included her as one of the 100 women who defined the 21st century.[12]</p>

            <h3>Life and Career</h3>
            <h5>1981–1996: Early life and career beginnings</h5>
            <p>Beyonce Giselle Knowles[a] was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas, to Celestine "Tina" Knowles (née Beyonce), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew 
                Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[13] Tina is Louisiana Creole, and Mathew is African American.[14][15][16][17] Beyoncé's younger sister, Solange Knowles, is also 
                a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.[18]</p>
            <p>Beyoncé's maternal grandparents, Lumas Beyince, and Agnez Dereon (daughter of Odilia Broussard and Eugene DeRouen),[19] were French-speaking Louisiana Creoles, 
                with roots in New Iberia.[20] Beyoncé is considered a Creole, passed on to her by her grandparents.[19][21] Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of many 
                French aristocrats from the southwest of France, including the family of the Viscounts de Béarn since the 9th century, and the Viscounts de Belzunce.[22] She is 
                a descendant of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians.[15]</p>
<p>Her fourth great-grandmother, Marie-Françoise Trahan, was born in 1774 in Bangor, located on Belle Île, France. Trahan was a daughter of Acadians who had taken refuge on Belle 
    Île after the Acadian expulsion. The Estates of Brittany had divided the lands of Belle Île to distribute them among 78 other Acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. 
    The Trahan family lived on Belle Île for over ten years before immigrating to Louisiana, where she married a Broussard descendant.[23] Beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered 
    that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave.[24] Her mother is also of distant Jewish, Spanish, Chinese and Indonesian ancestry.</p>
    <p>Beyoncé was raised Methodist and attended St. John's United Methodist Church.[28][29] She went to St. Mary's Montessori School in Houston, and enrolled in dance classes there.
        [30] Her singing was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[31] Beyoncé's interest in 
        music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's "Imagine" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[32][33] In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé 
        enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir.[34] She also attended the High School for the Performing
         and Visual Arts[35] and later Alief Elsik High School.[14][36] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was
          a soloist for two years.</p>
          <p>When Beyoncé was eight, she met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[38] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls,
             and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[39] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them
              in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[40][41] In 1995, 
              Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group.[42] The move reduced the family's income by half, and Beyoncé's parents were forced to sell their house and cars and 
              move into separated apartments.</p>
              <p>Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[38] The girls auditioned before record labels
                 and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[14] This put further strain on the 
                 family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under
                 an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance of Columbia talent scout Teresa 
                 LaBarbera Whites.[32]</p>
                 <h4>1997–2002: Destiny's Child</h4>
                 <p>The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[44] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song "Killing Time"
                     on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[41] In November, the group released their debut single and first major hit, "No, No, No". They released their self-titled debut album 
                     in February 1998, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul
                      Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for "No, No, No".[38]

                    The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as "Bills, Bills, Bills", 
                    the group's first number-one single, "Jumpin' Jumpin'" and "Say My Name", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. "Say My Name"
                     won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[38] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[40]
                      During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song "After All Is Said and Done" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.[45]</p>
                      <p>LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.[38] Beyoncé experienced depression following 
                        the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause.[46] Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time.[47] The depression was so 
                        severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything.[48] Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her
                         depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award, and she feared no one would take her seriously.[49] Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her 
                         fight it.[48] Franklin was then dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.[50]

                        The remaining band members recorded "Independent Women Part I", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard 
                        Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[38] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera,
                         starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[51] When the third album Survivor
                          was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[38] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 
                          copies sold.[52] The album spawned other number-one hits, "Bootylicious" and the title track, "Survivor", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with
                           Vocals.[53] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[38]
                        
                        In July 2002, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[54] which spent its first weekend atop the U.S. box office and 
                        grossed $73 million.[55] Beyoncé released "Work It Out" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[56] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding, Jr.,
                         in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[57] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[58][59] Beyoncé 
                         released "Fighting Temptation" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[60] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack,
                          "Summertime", fared better on the U.S. charts.[61]</p>
