                        <p>On Dec. 11, Mathew Graves, The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, stated that 10
                            teenagers were charged as adults in a string of carjackings across
                            Washington, D.C. The MPDC alleges they are responsible for 15 vehicle thefts
                            and reportedly held their victims at gunpoint. One of the arrested teenagers allegedly shot
                            a ride-share driver multiple times but did not end up succesfully taking the vehicle.
                            This is the largest federal carjacking arrest in D.C. of the year. </p>
