                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bananas: Mash three large, ripe bananas for 1 1/3 cups (11 ounces) of mashed bananas.</li>
                            <li>Flour: You’ll need 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
                            <li>Baking Powder and Baking Soda cause the bread to rise and makes it more tender.</li>
                            <li>Salt improves the flavor and texture and balances the sweetness.</li>
                            <li>Coconut Oil: Just two tablespoons of coconut oil adds some moisture while keeping the bread light.</li>
                            <li>Brown Sugar: I used Lakanto monkfruit for a healthier option, but light brown sugar will also work.</li>
                            <li>Egg: You’ll need one large egg.</li>
                            <li>Applesauce: Unsweetened applesauce replaces the oil.</li>
                            <li>Vanilla Extract for flavor</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h3> Instructions</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F, and grease an 8×5-inch loaf pan with baking spray.</li>
                                <li>Dry Ingredients: Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.</li>
                                <li>Wet Ingredients: Cream the coconut oil, applesauce, and sugar with a stand or hand mixer. Add the egg and vanilla and
                                    beat at medium speed until thick. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li>
                                    <li>Combine: Add half of the dry ingredients and blend on low speed until combined. Pour in the remaining flour mixture
                                         and the mashed bananas and blend on low, ensuring you don’t overmix.
                                        Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake on the center rack for 45 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out 
                                        clean but moist.
                                        Let the pan cool for at least 10 minutes, then turn it over to remove the loaf from the pan. The bread should be at 
                                        room temperature before slicing to ensure it doesn’t fall apart.</li>
